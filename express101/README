**`app` object has some methods: they are called http verbs or REST verbs!**

1. Get - READ -Default to all browsers is Get
2. post - CREATE
3. Delete - DELETE
4. Put - UPDATE

All the methods take 2 args: 1. path ('/') 2. a callback

The Routing system in express is meant to handle two things: 1.the type of http request 2. the path that you actually want to fetch





# **Use method**
**Express middleware**

Express middleware is a function or a set of functions that are executed during the request-response cycle in an Express.js application. It can modify the request object (req), the response object (res), or end the request-response cycle entirely.

Middleware functions are typically used for tasks such as:

**Logging requests.

Parsing request bodies (e.g., JSON, form data).

Authentication and authorization.

Error handling.

Serving static files.

Modifying headers or cookies.**


# express.static(root, [options])

This is a built-in middleware function in Express. It serves static files and is based on serve-static.

The root argument specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets. The function determines the file to serve by combining req.url with the provided root directory. When a file is not found, instead of sending a 404 response, it calls next() to move on to the next middleware, allowing for stacking and fall-backs.
